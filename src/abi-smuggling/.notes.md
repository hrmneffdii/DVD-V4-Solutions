### AuthorizedExecutor
- setPermissions -> bytes32[] memory ids
aims : to set mapping permissionsto be true as well as set the initialize become true

- execute -> address target, bytes actionData
aims: to exceute low level functionality, it including using call function
example, contract Target with actionData, it can draw as Target.call{value: 0}(actionData). But it required checking permision and function _beforeFunctioCall

- getActionId -> bytes4 selector, address executor, bytes memory actionData
aims : to create bytes32 from keccak, it is used for checking permission in mapping permission

- _beforeFunctionCall -> address target, bytes memory actionData
aims : this function internal virtual, waiting override from contract implementation. just make sure that the address target is address of contract SelfAuthorizedVault

### SelfAuthorizedVault
- onlyThis 
aims : to ensure the transaction can only be done by address(this)

- withdraw (onlyThis) -> address token, address recipient, uint256 amount
aims : require check for amount, must fewer than WITHDRAWAL_LIMIT, time of withdraw more than WAITING_PERIOD. After that, it change _lastWithdrawalTimestamp become block.timestamp(now), and make a transfer as usual

- sweepFundds (onlyThis) -> address receiver, IERC20 token 
aims : to send all of the funds from this address to receiver, it can occur due to an emergency

- _beforeFunctionCall -> address target
aims : just make sure that the address target is address of contract SelfAuthorizedVault
